!2 Exercise 2 - !-HelloWorld for FitNesse-!
Goal of this exercise is to create our first Slim table and fixture.

 2 Make Slim your test system by adding defining the following variable '''TEST_SYSTEM={slim}'''.
 3 Make the test fail.
 4 Create a !-HelloWorld-! class in your IDE and add a method to it that returns !-"Hello FitNesse"-!

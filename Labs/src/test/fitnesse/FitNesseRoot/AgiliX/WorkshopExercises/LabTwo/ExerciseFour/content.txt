!2 Exercice 4 - Refactor your table and your class
The goal of this exercise is to get introduced to the '''Script''' table and see some differences between the '''Script''' and the '''Decision''' tables.

Remember that it's about communication and creating a common understanding on what needs to be developed.
Think from the perspective of the Product Owner and other team members when you design your table. They care about the behavior and the understanding of the test when using !-FitNesse-!. Keep implementation details out of your tabels.
 
 1 Create a '''Script''' table in your !-SprintZero.SimpleCalculatorSpecification-! page for your Calculator class representing the same or additional examples. 
 2 Use the '''check''' keyword to match the calculation results.
 3 Make the test fail.
 4 Extend the Calculation class as needed to fit your expressive table.
 5 Make all the tests succeed.
 6 Refactor the Calculator class if needed or add a fixture class that separates the SUT from your table.
 7 Make all the tests succeed.

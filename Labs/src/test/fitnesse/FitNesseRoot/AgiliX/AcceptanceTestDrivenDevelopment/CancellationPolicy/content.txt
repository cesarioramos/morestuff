!2 Exercise 7

You are realizing a booking system. In this system you can make a reservations for training rooms.
Depending on when you cancel your reservation a part of the total price of the reservation has to be paid.
See below a generalized requirements description.

!4 Requirements
{{{
Cancellation policy for all in agreements
cancellation more then 6 months before arrival, No costs
cancellation more then 3 months before arrival, 10% of the total price
cancellation more then 2 months before arrival, 15% of the total price

cancellation more then 14 days before arrival, 60% of the total price
cancellation more then 7 days before arrival, 85% of the total price
cancellation less then 7 days before arrival, 100% of the total price
}}}

!4 a. Use a decision table to capture these requirements

|Calculate price percentage of a cancellation                         |
|Months before arrival|Price percentage of the total price to be paid?|
|7                    |0                                              |
|5                    |10                                             |
|4                    |10                                             |
|3                    |15                                             |
|2                    |35                                             |


|Calculate price percentage of a cancellation                       |
|Days before arrival|Price percentage of the total price to be paid?|
|15                 |60                                             |
|14                 |85                                             |
|8                  |85                                             |
|0                  |100                                            |

{{{ 
The above tables are a direct mapping of the requirement. Looking at these tables it is still unclear what should happen in case of cancellation 5 months
before arrival. Further more what are the costs that must be paid in case you cancel 5 months before arrival?
}}}

----

!4 b. Create a new version where you calculate the costs to be paid instead of the percentage.

|Calculate price percentage of a cancellation              |
|Months before arrival|Total cost of the reservation|Costs?|
|7                    |1000                         |0     |
|4                    |1000                         |100   |
|4                    |2500                         |250   |
|3                    |1000                         |150   |
|2                    |1000                         |350   |

|Calculate price percentage of a cancellation            |
|Days before arrival|Total cost of the reservation|Costs?|
|15                 |1000                         |600   |
|8                  |1000                         |850   |
|0                  |1000                         |1000  |

{{{
These are concrete examples including the actual amount you have to pay for cancellation. These tables are usefull if the cost of the reservation changes for every test. 
But in the case above it remains constant. The total amount of the reservation is duplicated in every row. Let's fix that so that our tables become more maintainable.
}}}

----

!4 c. Remove the duplication found in the above tables. 

|Calculate price percentage of a cancellation with a total reservation cost of|1000  |
|Months before arrival                                                        |Costs?|
|7                                                                            |0     |
|4                                                                            |100   |
|3                                                                            |150   |
|2                                                                            |350   |
|0                                                                            |1000   |

|Calculate price percentage of a cancellation with a total reservation cost of|1000  |
|Days before arrival                                                          |Costs?|
|15                                                                           |600   |
|8                                                                            |850   |
|0                                                                            |1000  |

{{{
This is good but can we make it better? Can we express the initial requirements exactly in FitNesse? Yes we can.
}}}

----

!4 d. Use scenario tables and a plain text tables to express the initial requirements exactly.

|set moreThenMonthsBeforeArrival|@numberOfMonths                                           |

!4 Lets use some BDD style formatting for our specification

So the format would be

GIVEN a reservation data of 10-10-2010
AND GIVEN a reservation price of 1000 euro
WHEN I cancel on 10-06-2011

!3 Exercise 5

The goal of this exercise is to learn how write BDD style tables. You will learn about Scenario Tables, 
Scenario Libraries and the Plain Text Table.

See below a user story selected from the backlog. 

'''Story: Customer withdraws cash '''
'''As''' a customer
 '''I want''' to withdraw cash from an ATM
 '''So that''' I don’t have to wait in line at the bank.

During the requirements workshop you discussed about how you could show that this user story works. 
As a Scrum Team e.g. the Product Owner, the Scrum Master and the Team, you came up with the requirement by example below.

'''Scenario''' Account is in credit
 '''Given''' the account has 10 dollars in credit
 '''And Given''' the dispenser contains 1000 dollars
'''When''' the customer withdraws 5 dollars
 '''Then''' ensure the account contains 5 dollars 
'''And Then''' ensure cash is dispensed from the dispenser
'''And''' the dispenser should have 995 dollars
